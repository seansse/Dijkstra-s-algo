# Dijkstra-s-algo
Dijkstra's algorithm that searches through a pair class that contains the Identification and weight of the node

This algorithm works with the created pair class in the file. First attribute would be identifiication number,second attribute is
the weiht/length.

Adjacent list is used in this situation. Created with an arraylist.

Time complexity: O((V + E) * log(V))
V: number of vertices
E: number of edges
